The User Management App is a React-based web application that allows users to manage a list of users. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), where users can:

View Users: The app fetches and displays user data from an external API (JSONPlaceholder).

Add New User: Users can add new entries by entering a username, company name, and optionally, a custom ID. If no ID is provided, 
one is auto-generated.

Edit User: Users can edit existing details like username and company name, with changes saved upon clicking the "Save" button.

Delete User: Users can delete any user from the list with a confirmation message.

The app also features simple inline styling for a clean interface and provides basic validation to ensure all necessary fields are filled before adding a new user. The app is designed to be intuitive, with features that allow users to efficiently manage their user list.
